Data Legends is a website that allows the user to look up the leaderboard of each region's league in League of Legends ranked. It also can be used to look up an individual player to see their ranked stats. This uses a Python with Django Framework backend to pull data from Riot's API. This data is then served as a REST API to a ReactJS frontend so that the user may view it. We plan to add more features such as match history and champion stats.
